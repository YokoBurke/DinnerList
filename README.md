# DinnerList
My first Kotlin App
This is my personal review of the content I learned at Google's "Android Basics in Kotlin" class.  

https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-unit-2-pathway-3#codelab-https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list

Content learned was to create list, and use it in RecyclerView.
